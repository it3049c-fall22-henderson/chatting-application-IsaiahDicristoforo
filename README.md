1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?

According to the bootstrap docs, "When you need a heading to stand out, consider using a display headingâ€”a larger, slightly more opinionated heading style." This heading is achieved using the bootstrap display class which is suffixed with -1, -2, -3, or -4, depending on how big you want the size of your heading to be.
